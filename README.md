# Decentralized-Storage-System-using-IPFS-
## Problem Statement
A decentralized storage system utilizes the spare memory of peers within the network. This solution employs Blockchain technology and integrates seamlessly with Pinata's IPFS service, ensuring secure and efficient decentralized storage.

## Objective
The project aims to create a platform that enables users to store their valuable information more securely on the web without relying on any organization for trust. Currently, people are using cloud storage or other storage options that are controlled by third parties who have complete control over user data. By implementing this system, we aim to eliminate the sole authority of any single organization over user data.
