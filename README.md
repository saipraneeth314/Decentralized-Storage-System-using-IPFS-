# Decentralized-Storage-System-using-IPFS-
## Problem Statement
This is a cloud storage system that operates in a decentralized manner in which peers 
spare memory is used for storing data, with the help of Blockchain
technology and Pinata, which offers an IPFS service.

## Objective
The objective of the project is to create a platform that enables users to store their valu-
able information more securely on the web without the need to rely on any organization
for trust. At present, people are using cloud storage or other storage options that are
controlled by third parties who have complete control over user data. By implementing
this system, we aim to eliminate the sole authority of any single organization over user
data
