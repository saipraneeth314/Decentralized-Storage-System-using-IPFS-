# Decentralized-Storage-System-using-IPFS-
## Problem Statement
This is a storage system that operates in a decentralized manner in which peers spare memory is used for storing data, with the help of Blockchain technology and Pinata, which offers an IPFS service.

## Objective
The project aims to create a platform that enables users to store their valuable information more securely on the web without relying on any organization for trust. Currently, people are using cloud storage or other storage options that are controlled by third parties who have complete control over user data. By implementing this system, we aim to eliminate the sole authority of any single organization over user data.
